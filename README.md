# Gameboy Emulator: GBMoo

<p>This project is my WIP attempt at making a Gameboy Emulator.</p>

<p>The end goal is to be able to run Pokemon Red/Blue</p>

## About the Project

<p>This emulator is written in C++ and uses SDL for inputs and eventually sound and uses OpenGL for graphics</p>

<p>Currently the repo has been rolled back to an SDL version for some further testing, but using the commented out OpenGL code it can be made
 to use OpenGL</p>

## Using This Repo

<p>You can use the MakeFile </p>

<p>Or compile manually (take a look at the Makefile) </p>

<p>You must find your own ROMs, I cannot provide any </p>
<p>If you are interested in improving this emulator feel free to submit some PRs :D </p>
